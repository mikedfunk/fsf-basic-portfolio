# The Coding Boot Camp @ UCLA Extension
## Homework 1 (Recommended): That Portfolio Though
The culmination of Homework 1 for [The Coding Boot Camp @ UCLA Extension](https://bootcamp.uclaextension.edu/coding/) is my three-page professional website. The site comprises the following files:

- **.gitignore**: file types to exclude in commits
- **README.md**: the current document
- **assets/common/footer.html**: HTML code for the footer common to the three main pages
- **assets/common/header.html**: HTML code for the header common to the three main pages
- **[assets/css/normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)**:  a stylesheet (CSS) to make browsers render elements consistently
- **assets/css/style.css**: a stylesheet (CSS) I wrote to create the look-and-feel specified in the mockup for the assignment
- **assets/bitmoji-cbz.png**: an image file (PNG) that serves as the site favicon
- **assets/img/blur-breed-hi-there.png**: an image file (PNG) for the portfolio.html page
- **assets/img/boxer-trio.png**: an image file (PNG) for the portfolio.html page
- **assets/img/dot-grid.png**: an image file (PNG) that serves as the background for the site
- **assets/img/english-bulldog-puppy.png**: an image file (PNG) for the portfolio.html page
- **assets/img/happy-border-collie.png**: an image file (PNG) for the portfolio.html page
- **assets/img/pit-peek-a-boo.png**: an image file (PNG) for the portfolio.html page
- **assets/img/portrait-cbz.png**: an image file (PNG)—my primary portrait—for the index.html page
- **assets/img/white-and-black-english-bulldog.png**: an image file (PNG) for the portfolio.html page
- **assets/js/header-footer-js**: a tiny script I wrote to serve the common header and footer across the site
- **contact.html**: the contact page (HTML), which contains a (non-functioning) form for interested parties to contact me
- **index.html**: the default page (HTML), which contains links to the resources needed to render my bio
- **portfolio.html**: the portfolio page (HTML), which will ultimately showcase my projects

I selected the site elements left to my discretion—including fonts, icons, and images—to reflect my personal style.
